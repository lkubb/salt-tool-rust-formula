# Mind that this is to be read as an overview of available
# settings which can be set in many different ways, not only
# by providing pillar values.
# The different sources will be merged. For further information,

# This documentation will need to be updated once there is

# Apart from the various source files, there are two independent source trees
# for user-specific configuration.
# Generally tool_rust > tool_global.
# `tool_global` focuses on specific users, of which most values
# will be respected by all formulae in the `tool` suite:
tool_global:
  users:

      # The following is global configuration for the user named `user`.
    user:

        # Force the usage of XDG directories for this user.
      xdg: true

        # Sync this user's config from a dotfiles repo.
        # The available paths and their priority can be found in the
        # rendered `config/sync.sls` file (currently, @TODO docs).
        # Overview in descending priority:
        # salt://dotconfig/<minion_id>/<user>/cargo
        # salt://dotconfig/<minion_id>/cargo
        # salt://dotconfig/<os_family>/<user>/cargo

        clean: false          # delete files in target. default: false

      rchook: '.config/zsh/zshrc'

        # This user's configuration for this formula. Will be overridden by

    # Specify an explicit version (works on most Linux distributions) or

    # by leaving version empty or setting it to 'latest'
    # (again for Linux, brew does that anyways).
  version: latest

    # Which method to use to install `rustup`. Currently available:
    # web, asdf, system (`pkg.installed`)
  install_method: web

    # Default formula configuration for all users.
  defaults:
    crates: default value for all users

    # User configuration can also be specified here in
    # `tool_rust:users`. It will override
    # configuration sourced from `tool_global:users`.
  users:
    user:
      persistenv: '.bash_profile'
      rust:
        crates: this overrides config from tool_globl:users
